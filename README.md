# DS-Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-Market
In this project, I conducted an analysis of the cryptocurrency market using historical data to better understand market trends and characteristics. The dataset utilized was sourced from the CoinMarketCap API and contained data on various cryptocurrencies' market capitalization, 24-hour and 7-day percent changes in value, and other relevant information.

Key findings from the analysis include:\
• The dominance of Bitcoin in market capitalization compared to other cryptocurrencies.\
• High levels of volatility observed in the market, with substantial percentage changes in value for both well-established and smaller cryptocurrencies.\
• The correlation between the size of a cryptocurrency and its risk/reward profile, with smaller cryptocurrencies exhibiting higher fluctuations in value.

Tools and technologies used: Python, pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook.
